ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Kevin: 23 years of age, with an insatiable curiosity.

An Irish Cyber Security researcher with a strong passion for writing and anything which encompasses the various fields of cybersecurity. I have been in front of a screen for much of my life (18 years to be exact), something that can be reflected in my inability to look at a screen for longer than 5 minutes!

I've been passionate about breaking things in the digital world for over 9 years, ever since the days of BackTrack 5 R3. Having stuck my nose where I shouldn't, I've seen quite a bit of what the underground can offer.

I graduated with a Bachelor of Science (BSc.) in Computer Science from Dublin City University in 2022 -- highly regarded as one of the most complex and technical IT-based degrees in the country.

Currently, I hold both the Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) and Offensive Security Web Expert (OSWE) certifications -- elite credentials that test real-world penetration testing and web exploitation skills. Both of these certificates have been achieved at the ages of 19 and 20 respectively, making me one of the youngest in Europe/Ireland to attain both.

Outside of CyberSec, I treat the gym as my second home, listen to too much rap/hip-hop music and obsess about growth and personal development. I also like to read, from fiction to philosophy. I'm a big Carl G Jung enjoyer.

KVDN is a personal project of mine, an identity I have created and worked on for many years. Initially intended to be used for apparel, I have since migrated it to a more cybersecurity focus. Through KVDN, I aim to fuse my love for cybersecurity with my passion for storytelling, hoping to inspire and educate.
